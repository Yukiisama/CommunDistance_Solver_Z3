\subsection*{Files}
\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
file \hyperlink{Graph_8h}{Graph.\+h}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Structure to store a graph statically, and to access to its informations easily. Includes source and target node informations, and supports several of them. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \hyperlink{Parsing_8h}{Parsing.\+h}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Contains function to convert graphviz files to the Graph\+List structure. Needs first to compile Lexer.\+lÂ and Parser.\+y with bison. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \hyperlink{Solving_8h}{Solving.\+h}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em An implementation of the Coca project for 2019 year. Convert a set of graphs to a formula true if and only if they all contain a simple accepting path of a given length, and provides functions to display the result if the formula is satisfiable. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \hyperlink{Z3Tools_8h}{Z3\+Tools.\+h}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This file contains functions to easily and transparently manipulate the Z3 S\+MT solver as a S\+AT solver without delving too much in the documentation. Note that most functions ask for a Z3\+\_\+context. This is needed by Z3, but in this case, simply create a context at the beginning and pass it as an argument every time needed. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
