\section{File List}
Here is a list of all documented files with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{include/\hyperlink{Graph_8h}{Graph.\+h} \\*Structure to store a graph statically, and to access to its informations easily. Includes source and target node informations, and supports several of them }{\pageref{Graph_8h}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{include/\hyperlink{Parsing_8h}{Parsing.\+h} \\*Contains function to convert graphviz files to the Graph\+List structure. Needs first to compile Lexer.\+lÂ and Parser.\+y with bison }{\pageref{Parsing_8h}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{include/\hyperlink{Solving_8h}{Solving.\+h} \\*An implementation of the Coca project for 2019 year. Convert a set of graphs to a formula true if and only if they all contain a simple accepting path of a given length, and provides functions to display the result if the formula is satisfiable }{\pageref{Solving_8h}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{include/\hyperlink{Z3Tools_8h}{Z3\+Tools.\+h} \\*This file contains functions to easily and transparently manipulate the Z3 S\+MT solver as a S\+AT solver without delving too much in the documentation. Note that most functions ask for a Z3\+\_\+context. This is needed by Z3, but in this case, simply create a context at the beginning and pass it as an argument every time needed }{\pageref{Z3Tools_8h}}{}
